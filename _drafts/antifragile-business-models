Under this challenge, we aim at addressing issues such as:

support in swiftly shifting production / service delivery to address the current needs (e.g. protective equipment)
tools and new business models too allow the service sector (e.g. tourism and horeca) to keep providing value to customers
easy tools to help start-ups and SMEs move online
new business models or ideas which would consider other big crisis, while creating jobs to recover from the economic crisis created by Covid-19.
quick and efficient job matching, to allow a match between rapidly changing jobs supply and demand, including for seasonal work and with priority for critical sectors (health, agriculture and food supply chain, etc.)
use of open source platform for e-commerce for click-and-collect online commerce services for free to any small and medium businesses.
